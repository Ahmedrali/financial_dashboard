## Implementation Plan Requirements

Please create a detailed implementation plan that:

- Addresses monorepo structure setup for Elixir and Svelte (as specifically mentioned in the learning objectives)
- Breaks down each of the 6 milestones into specific, actionable coding tasks
- Provides step-by-step guidance for implementing complex components (especially WebSocket connections, GenServers, and Svelte reactivity)
- Specifies file paths, module names, and function signatures where appropriate
- Recommends specific libraries and versions for both Elixir and JavaScript
- Suggests idiomatic patterns for Elixir and Svelte (with explanations of why they're recommended)
- Includes incremental testing strategies for each component
- Estimates time requirements for each step with reasonable buffers
- Identifies common technical challenges and provides detailed approaches to solve them
- Includes explicit debugging strategies for potential issues
- Incorporates performance considerations, especially for real-time data handling
- Suggests refactoring points as the codebase grows
- Aligns with the grading criteria percentages from the PDF
