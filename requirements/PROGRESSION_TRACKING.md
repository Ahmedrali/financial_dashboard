    - Solutions: Added `:finnhub_api_key` to `config/config.exs` for dev (with a note to use secrets/env vars) and configured `config/runtime.exs` to read `FINNHUB_API_KEY` from environment variables for production.

    - Challenges: Sending the correct subscription message to Finnhub, parsing incoming JSON trade data, and extracting relevant fields.
    - Solutions: In `FinnhubClient`, after connection, send `{"type":"subscribe","symbol":"AAPL"}`. Implemented `handle_finnhub_message` to parse JSON using `Jason`, extract price, symbol, and timestamp, log this data, and store it in ETS via `Dashboard.StockData.Cache`.
    - Aider Usage: Provided code for message sending, JSON parsing, and ETS interaction.
    - opto-gpt Usage: Helped clarify Finnhub message formats.
    - Learnings: Working with `Jason` for JSON processing, structure of Finnhub trade messages.

- [x] **Task 2.4**: Implement ETS Storage for Stock Data
    - Completed: [x] (Date/Time: 2025-05-10)

    - Solutions: Created `Dashboard.StockData.Cache` module with `init/0` (called by `StockData.Supervisor`), `put/2`, `get/1`, and `get_all_stocks/0`. The ETS table is named `:stock_data_cache` and configured for public access with read concurrency.

    - Completed: [x] (Date/Time: 2025-05-10)
    - Challenges: Detecting WebSocket disconnects/errors and implementing a robust retry mechanism.
    - Solutions: `FinnhubClient` handles `{:socket_error, ...}` and `{:socket_closed, ...}` messages from `websockex`. Implemented `schedule_reconnect/1` which uses `Process.send_after/3` to send a `:reconnect` message to itself, with a fixed delay and max attempts.
    - Aider Usage: Generated the error handling callbacks and reconnection logic.
    - opto-gpt Usage: Discussed different reconnection strategies (e.g., exponential backoff, though a simpler fixed delay was implemented for now).

    - Challenges: Ensuring data is broadcast correctly from `FinnhubClient` and that `StockChannel` sends initial data upon client join. Coordinating the `WebSockex.Client` callback module with the `FinnhubClient` GenServer.
    - Solutions:
        - Created `Dashboard.StockData.FinnhubWebSocketClient` to handle raw WebSocket events and forward them to `FinnhubClient`.
        - Modified `FinnhubClient` to use `DashboardWeb.Endpoint.broadcast/3` for live "stock_update" events.
        - Updated `StockChannel`'s `join/3` to fetch all data from `Cache` and send an `:after_join` message to itself.
        - Added `handle_info({:after_join, ...}, socket)` in `StockChannel` to push "initial_stocks" to the client.
    - Aider Usage: Generated the `FinnhubWebSocketClient` module, modifications for `FinnhubClient` broadcasting, and `StockChannel` updates.

- [x] **Task 3.2**: Create Data Transformation Utilities (if needed)
    - Completed: [x] (Date/Time: 2025-05-10)
    - Challenges: Determining how to calculate `daily_change_percent` and `previous_close` without an external daily data API.
    - Solutions:
        - Adopted a "session open price" strategy: the first price received for a stock during the application's current run is stored as `session_open_price` in ETS.
        - This `session_open_price` is then used as `previous_close` in the data payloads.
        - `daily_change_percent` is calculated as `((current_price - session_open_price) / session_open_price) * 100`.
        - `FinnhubClient` now enriches the cached data and the broadcasted `stock_update` payload with these fields.
        - `StockChannel` updated to map these new fields from cached data for the `initial_stocks` message.
    - Aider Usage: Generated code modifications for `FinnhubClient` and `StockChannel` to implement the calculation and data transformation.
    - opto-gpt Usage: Discussed strategies for handling `previous_close` and `daily_change_percent`.
    - Learnings: Importance of clearly defining data contracts. Simple strategies can be effective for initial implementation.

        - Updated `@initial_stocks_to_subscribe` in `FinnhubClient` to include all 10 required symbols.
        - Modified `+page.svelte` to iterate over the `$stocks` store (converted to a sorted array `stockList`) and render a `StockCard` for each. Added basic loading/empty states.
    - Aider Usage: Provided the updated stock list for the backend and the Svelte loop for dynamic rendering.
    - opto-gpt Usage: N/A.

    - Completed: [x] (Date/Time: 2025-05-10)
    - Challenges: Integrating a charting library into Svelte, ensuring reactive updates, and making the chart look decent within the `StockCard`.
    - Solutions:
        - Used `chart.js` with `svelte-chartjs`.
        - Created a `StockChart.svelte` component that takes `history` and `symbol` as props.
        - The component uses a reactive statement (`$:`) to update `chartData` and `chartOptions` when props change.
        - `StockCard.svelte` was updated to include `StockChart.svelte` and pass the `stock.history` and `stock.symbol`.
        - Basic styling applied to `StockChart.svelte` for size and to hide unnecessary elements like x-axis labels and legend for a cleaner look in the card.
    - Aider Usage: Generated the `StockChart.svelte` component structure, Chart.js configuration, and modifications to `StockCard.svelte`.

        - Created `PortfolioSummary.svelte` component to display total portfolio value (sum of current prices, assuming 1 share each) and average daily percentage change.
        - Added a Svelte `derived` store named `portfolioSummary` in `stockStore.js`. This store automatically recalculates summary data whenever the main `stocks` store changes.
        - Imported and rendered `PortfolioSummary.svelte` in `+page.svelte`.
        - The component handles cases where data might not be fully available yet (e.g., `stockCount` is 0).
    - Aider Usage: Generated the `PortfolioSummary.svelte` component, the derived store logic in `stockStore.js`, and modifications to `+page.svelte`.
    - opto-gpt Usage: Advised on using a Svelte derived store for reactive calculations.
    - Learnings: Implementing Svelte derived stores for efficient, reactive data aggregation. Structuring summary components.
    - Code Quality Improvements: Clear separation of summary logic into a derived store and its own component.
    - Performance Optimizations: Derived stores compute values only when their dependencies change, which is efficient.

- [x] **Task 4.5**: Implement Loading States and Basic Error Display
    - Completed: [x] (Date/Time: 2025-05-11)
    - Challenges: Ensuring all connection states are handled gracefully in the UI.
    - Solutions: Modified `+page.svelte` to display specific messages for 'connecting', 'error', and 'closed' states, both for the general connection status and for the stock data loading section. Leveraged the existing `$connectionStatus` store.
    - Aider Usage: Generated the Svelte code modifications for `+page.svelte` to implement the loading and error messages. Updated the progression tracking.
    - opto-gpt Usage: N/A for this sub-task.
    - Learnings: Effective use of Svelte's reactive statements and conditional rendering (`{#if...}{:else if...}`) to create a more informative user interface regarding connection and data states.
    - Code Quality Improvements: UI provides better feedback to the user about the application's state.
    - Performance Optimizations: N/A for this UI text change.

        - Used `ExUnit.CaptureLog.capture_log/1` to verify warning messages.
    - Aider Usage: Generated the `table_name/0` function, the `cache_test.exs` file structure and test cases, and updated this progression document.
    - opto-gpt Usage: Provided guidance on ExUnit test structure, ETS table management in tests, and log capturing.
