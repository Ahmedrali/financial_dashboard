There is a PDF file called "AiderAssignment2.pdf" which contains requirements for building a real-time financial dashboard using Elixir/Phoenix for the backend and Svelte for the frontend. Please begin by thoroughly analyzing this PDF to understand all requirements and milestones.

Based on your analysis of the PDF, I need your help creating two key deliverables:

1. A comprehensive implementation plan that follows best practices for Elixir/Phoenix and Svelte development
2. A progression tracking document to monitor the completion of each step and document AI assistance

## First: PDF Analysis

Before creating the plan, please:
- Read through the entire PDF
- Identify all key requirements and constraints
- Note any technical specifications that will influence the architecture
- Understand the 6 milestones outlined in the document
- Recognize the grading criteria (Milestone Completion 40%, Code Quality 20%, Architecture 15%, Testing 15%, Documentation 10%)

## Required Stocks Coverage

The plan must include implementation for displaying real-time data for these specific stocks as listed in the PDF:

1. Technology:
   - AAPL (Apple Inc.)
   - MSFT (Microsoft Corporation)
   - NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)
   - GOOGL (Alphabet Inc.)

2. Finance:
   - JPM (JPMorgan Chase & Co.)
   - BAC (Bank of America Corporation)
   - V (Visa Inc.)

3. Consumer:
   - AMZN (Amazon.com Inc.)
   - WMT (Walmart Inc.)
   - MCD (McDonald's Corporation)

## Implementation Plan Requirements

Please create a detailed implementation plan that:

- Addresses monorepo structure setup for Elixir and Svelte (as specifically mentioned in the learning objectives)
- Breaks down each of the 6 milestones into specific, actionable coding tasks
- Provides step-by-step guidance for implementing complex components (especially WebSocket connections, GenServers, and Svelte reactivity)
- Specifies file paths, module names, and function signatures where appropriate
- Recommends specific libraries and versions for both Elixir and JavaScript
- Suggests idiomatic patterns for Elixir and Svelte (with explanations of why they're recommended)
- Includes incremental testing strategies for each component
- Estimates time requirements for each step with reasonable buffers
- Identifies common technical challenges and provides detailed approaches to solve them
- Includes explicit debugging strategies for potential issues
- Incorporates performance considerations, especially for real-time data handling
- Suggests refactoring points as the codebase grows
- Aligns with the grading criteria percentages from the PDF

## Progression Tracking Document

Please create a progression tracking document that:

- Lists each implementation step with a checkbox and estimated completion time
- Groups steps by milestone and features
- Includes space for documenting:
  - Date/time of completion
  - Specific challenges encountered
  - Solutions applied and how they were developed
  - How Aider was used (specific prompts that were effective)
  - How opto-gpt was used for conceptual guidance
  - What was learned from each implementation step
  - Code quality improvements made
  - Performance optimizations applied
- Has sections for tracking:
  - Overall project progress as percentages
  - Test coverage
  - Documentation completeness
  - Lessons learned about Elixir, Phoenix, Svelte, and working with APIs

## Technical Implementation Guidance

For each major component, please provide:

1. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Detailed directory structure for the monorepo
   - Configuration for shared dependencies
   - Build process integration
   - Development workflow within the monorepo

2. **Elixir/Phoenix Backend**:
   - Supervision tree structure with explanation of the design choices
   - Step-by-step guide for implementing GenServers with proper error handling
   - Detailed approach for ETS implementation with code examples
   - Phoenix Channel implementation with authentication and security considerations
   - Specific error handling and reconnection strategies for WebSockets
   - Examples of idiomatic Elixir patterns applicable to this project

3. **Svelte Frontend**:
   - Component architecture with justification
   - Store implementation for managing state
   - WebSocket connection handling with reconnection logic
   - Step-by-step guide for implementing reactive UI components
   - Chart implementation recommendations with code examples
   - Performance optimization strategies for real-time updates

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Clear definitions of the data structures passed between backend and frontend
   - Message format specifications
   - Authentication flow
   - Error handling between systems

## Development Approach Guidance

Please evaluate and enhance this development approach:

1. Start with a single stock (AAPL) and implement the complete data flow from Finnhub to UI
2. Add proper error handling and reconnection logic early
3. Expand to include additional stocks once the foundation is solid
4. Implement sector grouping and portfolio summary features
5. Add visualization components
6. Enhance UI with advanced features and optimizations
7. Complete comprehensive testing
8. Finalize documentation

Please suggest refinements to this approach and explain the reasoning behind your suggestions.

## Debugging and Problem-Solving Strategies

Include a section on:
- Common issues when working with WebSockets and how to diagnose them
- Strategies for debugging Elixir concurrency problems
- Approaches for troubleshooting Phoenix Channels
- Methods for identifying performance bottlenecks
- Troubleshooting techniques for Svelte reactivity issues

## Learning Opportunities

For key implementation decisions, please:
- Explain why certain approaches are recommended over alternatives
- Highlight the patterns and principles being applied
- Note opportunities to learn about Elixir concurrency, functional programming, or Svelte reactivity
- Suggest resources for deeper understanding of the concepts used

## Documentation and Submission Requirements

Please include guidance that specifically addresses the submission requirements in the PDF:
- Setting up a proper GitHub repository structure
- Ensuring .aider files and interaction history are preserved
- Creating comprehensive tests for both backend and frontend
- Developing full documentation throughout the project
- Creating a detailed README.md with project description, setup instructions, architecture explanation, and screenshots
- Producing a complete Milestone.md report with paragraphs describing the accomplishment of each milestone, challenges encountered, how both AI assistants were utilized, and lessons learned

## Resources Integration

Please integrate usage of the specific resources mentioned in the PDF:
- Finnhub API Documentation (https://finnhub.io/docs/api)
- Elixir Documentation (https://elixir-lang.org/docs.html)
- Phoenix Framework (https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html)
- Svelte Documentation (https://svelte.dev/docs)
- Aider Documentation (https://aider.chat/docs/)

## Accommodating Knowledge Requirements

The plan should be accessible to someone with the minimum knowledge requirements specified in the PDF:
- Basic Elixir syntax and pattern matching
- Understanding of the actor model and GenServers
- Familiarity with Phoenix framework basics
- Knowledge of how WebSockets and Phoenix Channels work
- Svelte component structure and reactivity principles
- Basic knowledge of props and stores

Please ensure that more complex concepts are explained thoroughly for someone with this baseline knowledge.

Thank you! I'm looking forward to a comprehensive plan that will help me complete this assignment efficiently while learning best practices for Elixir/Phoenix and Svelte development. Please make sure the plan is specific enough that I can follow it step by step, but also includes explanations that will help me understand why certain approaches are recommended.
